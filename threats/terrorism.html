<b><u>Threat of terrorist attacks</u></b> has significantly increased after the armed conflict started in 2014. According to the State Security Service, the agency has prevented 28 terrorist attacks in Ukraine in 2016-2018 (8 of them in 2018), 35 people were detained and sentenced for terrorism in 2019. Bomb threats are also extremely disruptive, beginning during the Presidential Elections in March 2019 and increasing as a tactic throughout 2019. In 2020 the frequency has decreased, however, but this threat remains to airports, trains, train stations, bus stations, malls, public places, etc. <br><br>

<b><u>Though a terrorist attack targeting a Volunteer</u></b> is improbable based on historical frequency and current situational awareness, there remains a possibility of being “caught in the crossfire”, if in the wrong place at the wrong time. Also, risk increases at events/locations connected to political activity and/or the armed conflict (planned protests, fundraisers, etc.) as well as in locations near likely targets such as ammunition depots, strategic infrastructure, or churches. <br><br>

<b><u>To mitigate terrorist threat,</u></b> safety and security strategy includes site development guidelines and training that provides Volunteers with requirements of off-limits areas and strategies to avoid higher risk situations.<br>
