<b><u>Since March 2014</u></b> Ukraine has been involved in an armed conflict with Russia backed separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts. Major fighting took place in 2014 and 2015, also intensive shelling and shooting happened during 2016-2017.<br><br>

<b><u>On May 10, 2018</u></b> Russia-led-forces (RLF) attacked Avdiyivka, Donetska oblast  trying to push out Ukrainian forces with no success. On November 9, 2018  RLF attacked Krymske, Luhanska oblast trying to push out Ukrainian forces with no success. On November 24, 2018 Ukrainian forces captured Rozsadky village, Donetska oblast and moved the line for 1.5 km to the East. Sea of Azov remains volatile.<br><br>

<b><u>The conflict is seen as localized</b></u> with no significant changes in the balance of power, though levels of violence are fluctuating. As of mid-2019 the new Ukrainian government has been taking steps to stop the conflict and negotiate with Russia. Stakeholders widely agree that invasion by Russia is “unlikely but unpredictable” in the near future.<br><br>

<b><u>If situation deteriorates,</u></b> that could affect PCVs placed in eastern, southern and northern oblasts or the entire country, depending on the scale of escalation.<br><br>

<b><u>PCVs are not placed</u></b> near the line of conflict. Vulnerability is  effectively reduced through close monitoring of tensions, careful consideration of site placement, and robust response systems.
