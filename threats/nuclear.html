<b><u>Chernobyl nuclear disaster</u></b>  took place in 1986 and is considered the worst nuclear disaster in history. Chernobyl exclusion zone is an area originally extending 30 kilometers (19 mi) in all directions from the plant and is officially called the "zone of alienation." Even today, radiation levels are so high that the workers responsible for rebuilding the sarcophagus are only allowed to work five hours a day for one month before taking 15 days of rest. Some sources have given estimates for when the site would be considered habitable again:<br>
* 320 years or less (Ukraine state authorities)<br>
* 20,000 years or more (Chernobyl director Ihor Gramotkin)<br>
* Tens of thousands of years (Greenpeace, March 2016)<br>
* 3,000 years (Christian Science Monitor, 2016)<br>
As of 2016, 187 locals had returned and were living permanently in the zone.<br><br>


<b><u>There are four active nuclear power plants</u></b> in Ukraine: Rivne, Khmelnitsky, Yuzhnoukrainsk and Zaporizhzia.<br> 
No major nuclear accidents have been reported since the beginning of PC operations in Ukraine. However, given a historical frequency of accidents (as recent as a 2014 short circuit in Zaporizhzhia which caused outages though it was resolved without danger of radiation to the surrounding area), plus the added possibility of nuclear accident caused by sabotage or armed conflict, probability is medium.<br>

An exception received by post in 2017 for one PCV placed within 30 km of a nuclear power source who COSed  in 2019.  No approval of new exception requests anticipated. Radiation hazards also may exist near uranium industrial mines in Kirovohradska and Dnipropetrovska oblasts.<br><br>

<b><u>Vulnerability is effectively reduced</u></b> through careful consideration of proximity to nuclear power plants during site selection. 
PCVs are not placed within areas significantly polluted in result of Chornobyl disaster, and within 30km zone around four active nuclear power plants.
