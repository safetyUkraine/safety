<b><u>The impact of COVID-19 infection</u></b> on the country is significant due to the nature of the disease and how its spreads, high density of population, and the limited ability of the country’s health system to handle a high number of infected persons.<br><br>

<b><u>Vulnerability to disease</u></b> epidemics/pandemics (including COVID-19) may be decreased to some degree through training, site selection, policies, guidance, ongoing monitoring, and robust response mechanisms. However, PCV vulnerability cannot be entirely eliminated, due to various factors including their frequent reliance on public transport, exposure to community members without assurance of recommended prevention measures, and fragile health systems in country which have been further stressed under COVID-19.<br><br>

<b><u>Ukraine is divided</u></b> into four epidemiological zones (green, yellow, orange, and red) depending on the COVID-19 situation in each region. The Ministry of Health will assign each zone a color based on four COVID-19-related criteria. Each zone triggers a distinct set of quarantine restrictions. Local authorities should be checked regarding local quarantine guidelines. <br><br>

<b><u>Adaptive quarantine</u></b> has been extended until October 31, 2020. The quarantine was expanded to ban discos, nightclubs, and concerts in green-zoned regions; restaurants, bars, and cafes are not allowed to work after 12 am. <br><br>

<b><u>Wearing masks</u></b> is mandatory in public transportation and indoor public places. Individuals and establishments can be fined for not complying. Everyone should carry ID.<br><br>
