<b><u>Confirmed hazardous areas</u></b>  are known, and are located in areas placed off-limits by Peace Corps policy.  However, military depots have accidents and grenades are used in civilian areas in all regions regularly. Our primary concern when preparing for an emergency in ammunition storage areas is personal safety. An accident strikes suddenly, violently and without warning. Identifying potential hazards ahead of time and advance planning can reduce the dangers of serious injury from depots explosions.<br><br>

<b><u>Vulnerability is effectively reduced</b></u> through implementation of clear policy prohibiting Volunteer travel to the hazardous areas, site selection strategy which takes into account locations of military depots, and training of Volunteers accordingly. However, due to unpredictable use of grenades in civilian areas across all regions, some vulnerability still remains.
