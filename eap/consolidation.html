<b>Consolidation is used</b> when having PCVs together provides greater safety or enhances logistical support. During Consolidation Volunteers travel to a designated meeting point.<br><br>

<b>Situations, when Consolidation may be needed:</b><br>
•	Threat of terrorist attack at PCVs site<br>
•	There is a credible information of an invasion or large scale attack progresses in the conflict zone<br>
•	Protests become violent and are ongoing (but it is safe for Volunteers to move)<br>
•	Political instability such as a coup, post-election violence, or major transitions of power<br>
•	There is a direct threat to PCVs because of explosions, if they stay at their sites<br>
•	PCVs must move out of their sites due to radiation risk<br>
