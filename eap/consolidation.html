            <p><b>Most theft incidents</b> that happen to PC Volunteers are pickpocketing and take place during travel. Majority of cases happen in Kyiv metro and in/near Central Train Station. <br><br>

                <b>Main mitigation measure</b> is to use situational awareness and remember, that someone is a suitable target for a theft, if they:<br>
                * are distracted;<br>
                * openly display money or valuables;<br>
                * are intoxicated;<br>
                * leave their belongings unattended;<br>
                * are in the large crowd.<br><br>
                
                <b>In case theft happened:</b><br>
                <ol>
                <li>Report to SSM exactly what was stolen: cash, bank cards, property (cell phone, digital camera, etc.) and the circumstances of the theft: place, method used and if there are any suspects.</li>
                <li>Consider taking some actions for recovering the property. For instance, if the purse/wallet disappeared in a café, Volunteer might try to go there and ask the personnel if they found it.</li>
                <li>If bank cards were stolen, call 24-hour bank card service center in Ukraine and the US bank depending on the cards origin and block them ASAP.</li>
                <li>If passport and/or registration document “posvidka” are stolen, police report must be filed.</li>
                <li>If PCV loses a property that is covered with US insurance police report is required for claiming insurance reimbursement.</li>
